Mnemonics
=========
Mnemonics are shortcuts that let you quickly create data structures by typing in names which are mnemonic (of similar sound) to what you're creating.

For example, typing `c` and pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> creates something like this:

    public class MyClass
    {
      |
    }

The vertical bar above indicates where the caret will end up once you're done editing the name of the class.
